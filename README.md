# **Welcome to The Witch's Cauldron**



An online community coven for those who have a solid wiccan / aesoteric practice, or for the curious. 
Members can post their own spells and rituals and tray practices from other members allowing them to greatly expand their knowledge of other wordly rituals. It is perfect for wiccans or wiccan curious who may not b e able to find a local coven, or even those who prefer to practice alone but enjoy learning from others.

### Agile Methodology

Themes, Epics and User Stories were all divided up and added as issues in the issues tab of Github 

![Acc Management screenshot](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/acc-management.png)

Each Theme, Epic and User Story was given a label(s) to visually connect to the theme or epic it belonged to.

![Admin Features screenshot](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/admin-features.png)

Each Epic and User Story was color coded to have more harmonious connection to the Theme.

![Post Interaction screenshot](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/post-interaction.png)

User Stories had acceptance criteria/tasks in the form of check boxes. In this example I tested this feature from the admin panel first and added screenshot in the comments as I know I will have to test this function again after I create the views.

[User Story Acceptance criteria](https://github.com/rachel-o-donnell/the-witchs-cauldron/issues/9) 
Here is another example:
[!User Story Acceptance criteria](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/acceptance-criteria%3Atasks.png) 

All issues were coverted to a Github Kanban project board found in the Github Projects tab or by clicking 

[The Witch's Cauldron Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/rachel-o-donnell/projects/9/views/1)

Product Backlogs were created using the Milestones feature in Github. 1 main product board was created 1st and each iteration was drawn from this board in order of priority.

Product Backlog (main) with MoSCoW labels - Screenshot taken at the start of Iteration 2.

![Product Backlog (main) with MoSCoW](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/main-product-backlog-moscow.png)

Timeboxing was used by creating Iterations in the Milestones tab of Github with each iteration being one week long. 

![Milstones tab](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/milestones.png)


Issues were added to each iteration at the start of each week using MosCow prioritisation (with new labels added to each issue) and using the 60% 20% rest method. These issues were also ordered from top priority on the top of the list down.

Issues that were not completed were added back into the main Product Backlog Milestone at the end of each iteration and the board was reprioritised.

![Iteration 1](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/it-1-product-backlog.png)

1st week I was ahead of my iteration so I began working on 2nd iteration early.

![Iteration 1](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/it2-pb.png)

The current iteration led the management of the kanban board- again laid out with a product backlog style in mind with prioritised issues on the top of the list. This helped me visually focus as you could no longer see the MoSCoW labels without clicking into each item. 

Kanban Iteration 1

Kanban Iteration 6
![Kanban Iteration 6](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/iteration-6.png)


Kanban Final Iteration 
During the final iteration it became clear that I would not have time to finish the profiles I had started so I decided to add it to my future features list and complete the front end of posting content. Originally I had wanted only admins to post but I thought it best to have all users post for better community engagement.

![Kanban Iteration Final](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/final-iteration.png)

Kanban Final Iteration FUTURE FEATURES

At the final iteration I created a future features section in the kanban board. All issues that had been marked as could have/should have/wont have that never made it through production have been added to the future features section on the kanban board fo ease of access for developing the site further. 

![Kanban Iteration Final Future Features](/assets/images/readme-images/agile/final-iteration--future.png)

### Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq and can be found [here](assets/images/readme-images/wireframes)
![Homepage desktop](assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/home-view-desktop.png)
![Homepage mobile](assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/home-moblie.png)
![Create Post mobile](assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/create-post-moblie.png)
![log in/ sign up mobile](assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/login-signup-moblie.png)
![View Post mobile](assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/view-post-%20moblie.png)


### Colour Scheme

Neutral natural colors were chosen for the site using Coolers. I made every effort for color blind accesability here to ensure all tones would differ. 

![Colour Palette](/assets/images/readme-images/colors/color-palette-original.png)

All colorblind variants can be found [here](/assets/images/readme-images/colors)

As I was styling the project along the way I realised that the site had much better impact with the use of tints of the colour in the background and that it was a much better ux/ui to have black writing and a white background. 


![Tint Palette](/assets/images/readme-images/colors/tints.png)

### Typography

Amatic SC - playful and homemade - a nod to the inviting and not so serious nature of the blog.
![Amatic](/assets/images/readme-images/logo-font.png)

Amiri - Has an early modern feel like - the classical period of witch hunts.
![Amiri](/assets/images/readme-images/font.png)

### Images and Iconography

3 images were drawn up using Procreate and an Apple Pencil on an IPad.

I wanted the images to be playful, homemade, rough around the edges much like the community and aesoteric practices. The site wants to draw community members in as it can be quite an intimidating interest. 

Cauldron: though most wiccans just use whatever is lying aroung the iconic image of bubbling cauldron is perfect for this melting pot of practices. 

![Cauldron](/assets/images/readme-images/cauldron.png)

Broom: The broom is indeed a part of many rituals of sweeping bad energy out of the area, so I thought it perfect as a way to "clean up" your mistakes on the site with the edit and delete features. 

![Broom](/assets/images/readme-images/broom.png)

Hat: A pointy witches hat 
![Hat](/assets/images/readme-images/hat_png.png)
Though only two are used on the current live site - The hat was to be a default profile image and relate to all profile pages.

### Database Schema

I used DrawSQL to map out my database 
![Draw SQL](/assets/images/readme-images/draw-sql.png)

### Design changes

colors - much preferred going with cleaner simpler colors - white - no greys. The black writing was better visually than the dark grey and better visibility.

initially I wanted to override the bootstrap blue color and the alert messages but I think they went really well when I simplified the color sheme.

our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original
repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub
   Repository](https://github.com/ianmeigh/support-hub)
1. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings"
   Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
1. Click the button (not the number to the right) and you should now have a copy
   of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rachel-o-donnell/the-witchs-cauldron).
1. Under the repository name, click "Code".
1. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", copy the link.
1. Open your local terminal with git installed
1. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be created.
1. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

    ```console
    ~$ git clone https://github.com/rachel-o-donnell/the-witchs-cauldron
    ```

1. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/rachel-o-donnell/the-witchs-cauldron
    > Cloning into `test-dir`...
    > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
    > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
    > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
    > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
    ```

1. Change the current working directory to the cloned project folder (this will be a child directory in the location you cloned the project).

1. It is recommended to use a virtual environment during development ([learn more about virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)). If you would prefer not to use on please skip the following steps:
    1. Create a virtual environment in the projects working directory by entering the following command in the same terminal window used for the steps above `python3 -m venv .venv`.
    1. Before use, the virtual environment will need to be activated using the command `source .venv/bin/activate` in the same terminal window used previously.
1. Packages required by the project can now using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. In the cloned directory, rename the file `.env-example` to `.env` and populate it with the information required.
1. Make django migrations using the command `python3 manage.py makemigrations`

### DATABASE
Create an account and set up a project with ElephantSQL. Steps can be found here. [elephansql](https://www.elephantsql.com/docs/)

### Deploying with Heroku

**NOTE**: It is a prerequisite of deployment to Heroku that you already have access to the following:

- A Cloudinary account, create one for free at [https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com).

**NOTE**: It is assumed you have followed all deployment instructions listed in this readme starting with the section titled 'Forking the GitHub Repository'.

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and if not taken there automatically, navigate to your personal app dashboard.
1. At the top of the page locate the 'New' drop down, click it and then select 'Create new app'.
1. Give your application a unique name, select a region appropriate to your location and click the 'Create app' button.
1. Your app should now be created, so from the menu towards the top of the page select the 'Resources' section.
1. Search for 'Heroku Postgres' under the Add-ons section and add it.
1. From the menu towards the top of the page select the 'Settings' section and lick 'Reveal Config Vars' in the Config vars section. Enter the following key / value pairings:
    1. Key as `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and the value as the name of you project with '.herokuapp.com' appended to the end e.g.  `example-app.herokuapp.com`. Click the Add button.
    1. Key as `CLOUDINARY_URL` and the value as your cloudinary API Environment variable e.g. `cloudinary://**************:**************@*********`. Click the Add button.
    1. Key as `SECRET_KEY` and the value as a complex string which will be used to provide cryptographic signing. The use of a secret key generator is recommended such as [https://djecrety.ir](https://djecrety.ir/). Click the Add button.

    1. `DataBase` as the `url link` from your elephantsql project.
    1. Set `PORT`  value as `8000`
Django (Framework)
    1. The `DATABASE_URL` should be copied into your local `.env`, created during the cloning process.
1. Open the `.env` file in the project directory and delete the key / value pair `DEV_ENVIRONMENT_DATABASE = True` before saving the file. This can be added back after the next step to ensure local development changes will not alter the remote database.
1. Running migrations on the remote database
    1. Open your local terminal and change the current working directory to that of the project folder.
    1. Make django migrations using the command `python3 manage.py migrate`.
1. Navigate to the 'Deploy' page using the menu towards the top of the page.
1. Select 'GitHub' from the 'Deployment method' section and you will be prompted to 'Connect to GitHub'.
1. Once connected to your GitHub account you will be able to search for your repository which contains the forked 'The Witchs Cauldron' repository.
1. Once the repository is found click 'Connect'.
1. At the bottom of the page find the section named 'Manual deploy', select the 'main' branch in the drop down and click the 'Deploy' button.
1. Once deployment is complete, click the 'View' button to load the URL of the deployed application.

**SET DEBUG TO FALSE IN SETTINGS.PY BEFORE FINAL DEPLOYMENT**

### Code

Using Code Institute's "I Think Therefore I Blog" runthrough as a base for guidence and adapting as much as possible.

***admin.py - PostAdmin and Admin comment - Add features to expand/make different (minimal I could change here yet- possibly add a category tag if that becomes a feature later on)

Footer - Base code example and addapted to suit the needs and style of the project https://mdbootstrap.com/snippets/standard/mdbootstrap/2885129?view=side

justify-content-end not working when copied from bootstrap - needed to add to the parent. Anurag Srivastava: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61174994/bootstrap-justify-content-end-not-working-as-expected

### ReadMe 

I used the skeleton of Ian's ReadMe to help me put a structure of my ReadMe together as a starting point. 

- https://github.com/ianmeigh/support-hub/blob/main/README.md 

I also used his testing.md structure as a skeleton and ideas to add docs with links, links to projects board etc. 

Tips from the below video README: Worth Reading, with Joanna Gorska on the Code Institute Channel.
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1UiUXrp7Ic

- The very detailed deployment was also taken from his READMe and altered to suit.
