### Agile Methodology

Themes, Epics and User Stories were all divided up and added as issues in the issues tab of Github 

![Acc Management screenshot](assets/README-images/agile/acc-management.png)

Each Theme, Epic and User Story was given a label(s) to visually connect to the theme or epic it belonged to.

![Admin Features screenshot](assets/README-images/agile/admin-features.png)

Each Epic and User Story was color coded to have more harmonious connection to the Theme.

![Post Interaction screenshot](assets/README-images/agile/post-interaction.png)

User Stories had acceptance criteria/tasks in the form of check boxes. In this example I tested this feature from the admin panel first and added screenshot in the comments as I know I will have to test this function again after I create the views.

[User Story Acceptance criteria](https://github.com/rachel-o-donnell/the-witchs-cauldron/issues/9) 

All issues were coverted to a Github Kanban project board found in the Github Projects tab or by clicking 

[The Witch's Cauldron Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/rachel-o-donnell/projects/9/views/1)

Product Backlogs were created using the Milestones feature in Github. 1 main product board was created 1st and each iteration was drawn from this board in order of priority.

Product Backlog (main) with MoSCoW labels - Screenshot taken at the start of Iteration 2.

![Product Backlog (main) with MoSCoW](assets/README-images/agile/main-product-backlog-moscow.png)

Timeboxing was used by creating Iterations in the Milestones tab of Github with each iteration being one week long. 

![Milstones tab](assets/README-images/agile/milestones.png)


Issues were added to each iteration at the start of each week using MosCow prioritisation (with new labels added to each issue) and using the 60% 20% rest method. These issues were also ordered from top priority on the top of the list down.

Issues that were not completed were added back into the main Product Backlog Milestone at the end of each iteration and the board was reprioritised.

![Iteration 1](assets/README-images/agile/it-1-product-backlog.png)

1st week I was ahead of my iteration so I began working on 2nd iteration early.

![Iteration 2](assets/README-images/agile/it2-pb.png)

The current iteration led the management of the kanban board- again laid out with a product backlog style in mind with prioritised issues on the top of the list. This helped me visually focus as you could no longer see the MoSCoW labels without clicking into each item.

### Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq and can be found [here](assets/Wireframes/)

![Homepage desktop](assets/Wireframes/home-view-desktop.png)

### Colour Scheme

Neutral natural colors were chosen for the site using Coolers. I made every effort for color blind accesability here to ensure all tones would differ. 

![Colour Palette](assets/README-images/colors/color-palette-original.png)

All colorblind variants can be found [here](assets/README-images/colors)

### Typography

Amatic SC - playful and homemade - a nod to the inviting and not so serious nature of the blog.
Amiri - Has an early modern feel like - the classical period of witch hunts.

### Images and Iconography

### Database Schema

### Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

#1 Missing comma after 'cloudinary_storage' in INSTALLED_APPS section of Settings.py creating error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cloudinary_storagedjango' found when dry running migration.

#2 in PostSpell/models.py:
 Fix bug#2 in PostSpell/models.py. Missing capital F in CharField and SlugField creating  AttributeError: module 'django.db.models' has no attribute 'Slugfield'/'CharField' found in migration dry run. 

#3 Default image was not displaying - I needed to change the address. image by Jalyn Bryce.

#4 Username and body not displaying in comment section - changed to user.username and comment_area 

#5 Comment area would disapear after adding comment needed to rearrange the code

#6 Heroku deployment crash - 1st fix was an attempt but incorrect - I had not added crispy forms to requirements.txt.

#7 - alert messages were not showing on edit_comment leading me to realised I had not set them up correctly to display. Needed to add custom messages to respective views, -set import a mixin for class based views, set up the call to show the messages in the base.html and override the django/bootsrap clash in settings.

#8 - SuccessMessageMixin does not work on Deleteview https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/21926 needed to add workound code found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24822509/success-message-in-deleteview-not-shown ans:Heyl1

#10 - Can't have unique=true with a default setting in models. 

#11 - Import User to Views.py 

#12 - Wrong user showing in profile - I was calling User pk instead of Profile pk

#14 - Errors in views after deleteing status from model - forgot to remove ALL status calls/filters from views.py

### Remaining Bugs
