### Agile Methodology

Themes, Epics and User Stories were all divided up and added as issues in the issues tab of Github 

![Acc Management screenshot](assets/README-images/agile/acc-management.png)

Each Theme, Epic and User Story was given a label(s) to visually connect to the theme or epic it belonged to.

![Admin Features screenshot](assets/README-images/agile/admin-features.png)

Each Epic and User Story was color coded to have more harmonious connection to the Theme.

![Post Interaction screenshot](assets/README-images/agile/post-interaction.png)



All issues were coverted to a Github Kanban project board found in the Github Projects tab or by clicking 

[The Witch's Cauldron Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/rachel-o-donnell/projects/9/views/1)

*** insert progress photos

Product Backlog were created using the Milestones feature in Github 
Timeboxing was used by creating Iterations in the Milestones tab of Github with each iteration being one week long. 
Issues were added to each iteration at the start of each week using MosCow prioritisation, and the 60% 20% rest rule 
The current iteration led the management of the kanban board.


### Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq and can be found [here](assets/Wireframes/)

![Homepage desktop](assets/Wireframes/home-view-desktop.png)

### Colour Scheme

Neutral natural colors were chosen for the site using Coolers. I made every effort for color blind accesability here to ensure all tones would differ.

All colorblind variants can be found [here](assets/README-images/colors)
