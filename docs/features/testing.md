# Testing

## Automated Tests

Due to the time constraints of this project, partial automated testing was implemented as part of the release phase.

## Manual Tests

### Methodology

Manual testing occurred regularly throughout local development, making use of statements that would print information to the console and use of the Django debug pages.

Each function of the website had specific testing requirements which were documented as test cases. The aim of documenting these test cases was that they could be run before pull requests were committed to ensure no breaking changes were introduced. Tests were documented as the site evolved so new tests for new functionality could be easily added.

### Test Cases

## Code Validation

### HTML

The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Services were used to validate the project's HTML and CSS files to ensure there were no syntax errors or warnings.

Tests passed with the exception of pages that made use of the *django-summernote* widget. The majority of these errors were fixed (as discussed in the [Changes as a result of testing](#changes-as-a-result-of-testing) and the [bugs](README.md#bugs) sections), but one error caused by *django-summernote* widget has been ignored.

![HTML validation error 3](docs/validation/html/w3c-html-validation-service-error-3.png)

The error is caused by *django-summernote* setting the hidden attribute on a textarea element within it's python code [Link to django-summernote source - widgets.py](https://github.com/summernote/django-summernote/blob/main/django_summernote/widgets.py#L49). This error has been ignored and this is clearly visible in the screenshots of tests.

### CSS

No validation errors reported.

- [Results for CSS](docs/validation/css/w3c-css-validation-service-results.png)

#### Changes as a result of testing

Link alt text was changed to use the title attribute based on the following error returned from the validation tool:

![HTML Validation Error 1](docs/validation/html/w3c-html-validation-service-error-1.png)

The SummernoteWidget makes use of an iFrame which was being loaded with attributes that caused HTML validation errors.

[Link to HTML Validation Error 2](docs/validation/html/w3c-html-validation-service-error-2.png)

To correct this I made a copy of the 'widget_iframe' template to my root templates directory so it is selected first. I then edited the template to remove the attributes causing validation errors, replacing the width with CSS.

### Python

No validation error reported when using the [PEP8 Online Check Tool](http://pep8online.com/)

### JavaScript

No validation errors reported testing with [JSHint](https://jshint.com).

![Results for JavaScript](docs/validation/javascript/jshint-results.png)

## WAVE - Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool

All pages were tested using the [WAVE Firefox extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/). No errors were returned for any pages and the report for the homepage can be viewed below:

![Results for JavaScript](docs/validation/wave/wave-report-supporthub-homepage.png)

## Lighthouse Scores

Most pages of the site when tested with a desktop or mobile device view performed very well, with pages scoring above 90% for performance and accessibility, and 100% for Best Practices. 2 pages under mobile device testing dropped to 87% performance (with this number varying slightly under repeated testing).

Original ticket creation page score - Mobile

Original ticket list page score - Mobile

![Original ticket list page score](docs/validation/lighthouse/lighthouse-report-ticket-list-mobile.png)

After investigation this issue was caused due to leaving script tags in the head element which was blocking the first paint of the page (an oversight left in place from early development work). Also the summernote iframe did not have a title, as I had altered the template to correct other problems (detailed in the [Bugs](README.md#bugs) section), I simply added a title to the iframe element manually.

Once the script tags were moved to the bottom on the body element and the iframe title added, site performance improved on all pages with only the ticket detail page scoring less than 90%. This was due to loading CSS files from Bootstrap and Cloudinary and requires future work to fully investigate and resolve.
